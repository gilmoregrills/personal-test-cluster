# Test Cluster Terraform Templates

Terraform templates for my simple test cluster running on GKE

## To Deploy:

If your gcloud CLI is set up properly then it's just a case of running `terraform init`
and `terraform apply` from local.

Travis will deploy on every commit to master soon, once I've actually got it working.
